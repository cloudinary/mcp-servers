# Cloudinary MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a new, standardized protocol for managing context between large language models (LLMs) and external systems. This repository provides comprehensive MCP servers for Cloudinary's media management platform, enabling you to use natural language to upload, transform, analyze, and organize your media assets directly from AI applications like Cursor and Claude.

With these MCP servers, you can seamlessly manage your entire media workflow through conversational AI - from uploading and transforming images and videos, to configuring automated processing pipelines, analyzing content with AI-powered tools, and organizing assets with structured metadata. Whether you're building media-rich applications, managing large asset libraries, or automating content workflows, these servers provide direct access to Cloudinary's full suite of media optimization and management capabilities.

The following MCP servers are available for Cloudinary:

## Installation

### Remote MCP Servers (Recommended)

Remote MCP servers are hosted by Cloudinary and ready to use immediately. No local installation required.

### Local MCP Servers

Local MCP servers run on your machine using npm packages. Choose this option if you need more control or customization.

**Note**: You'll need to configure your environment variables (`CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`) with your actual credentials after installation.

## Configuration Examples

### Remote MCP Servers Configuration

Remote servers are hosted by Cloudinary and accessed via URL:

```

### Local MCP Servers Configuration

Local servers run on your machine using npm packages:

#### Option 1: Using CLOUDINARY_URL environment variable (Recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudinary-asset-mgmt": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package", "@cloudinary/asset-management", "--", "mcp", "start"],
      "env": {
        "CLOUDINARY_URL": "cloudinary://api_key:api_secret@cloud_name"
      }
    },
    "cloudinary-env-config": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "--package", "@cloudinary/environment-config", "--", "mcp", "start"],

  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudinary-asset-mgmt": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y", "--package", "@cloudinary/asset-management",
        "--",

        "--cloud-name", "cloud_name",
        "--api-key", "api_key",
        "--api-secret", "api_secret"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### MediaFlows MCP Server Configuration

For MediaFlows, use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mediaflows": {
      "url": "https://mediaflows.mcp.cloudinary.com/v2/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "cld-cloud-name": "cloud_name",
        "cld-api-key": "api_key",
        "cld-secret": "api_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Local Server Configuration

Each npm package supports additional configuration options beyond the basic setup examples above.

#### Running as SSE Server

To run a local MCP server using Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport instead of stdio:

```bash
npx -y --package @cloudinary/asset-management -- mcp start --transport sse
```

You can specify a custom port (default is 2718):

```bash
npx -y --package @cloudinary/asset-management -- mcp start --transport sse --port 3000
```

#### Available Configuration Options

To see all available configuration options for any package:

```bash
npx -y --package @cloudinary/asset-management -- mcp start --help
```

**Complete list of available flags:**

```
USAGE
  mcp start [--transport stdio|sse] [--port value] [--tool value]...
            [--scope admin|builder|librarian] [--api-key value]
            [--api-secret value] [--oauth2 value] [--cloud-name value]
            [--server-url value] [--server-index value]
            [--region api|api-eu|api-ap] [--api-host value]

  --server-index    Selects a predefined server used by the SDK
  --region          Sets the region variable for url substitution
                    [api|api-eu|api-ap]
  --api-host        Sets the host variable for url substitution
  --log-level       The log level to use for the server

  --env...          Environment variables made available to the server
  -h, --help        Print help information and exit
```

#### Debugging

For detailed network payload debugging, use the `CLOUDINARY_DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
CLOUDINARY_DEBUG=true npx -y --package @cloudinary/asset-management -- mcp start
```

You can combine debug mode with other options for comprehensive troubleshooting:

```bash
CLOUDINARY_DEBUG=true npx -y --package @cloudinary/asset-management -- mcp start --transport sse --log-level debug
```

**Note:** These configuration options apply to all local MCP packages:
- `@cloudinary/asset-management`
- `@cloudinary/environment-config`
- `@cloudinary/structured-metadata`
- `@cloudinary/analysis`

## Authentication

When running MCP servers locally, authentication can be configured in several ways:

### Option 1: Individual environment variables (Recommended)
```bash
export CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="cloud_name"
export CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="api_key"
export CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="api_secret"
```

### Option 2: CLOUDINARY_URL environment variable
```bash
export CLOUDINARY_URL="cloudinary://api_key:api_secret@cloud_name"
```

### Option 3: Command line arguments
Pass credentials directly as arguments (see configuration examples above)

You can find your Cloudinary credentials in your [Cloudinary Console Dashboard](https://console.cloudinary.com/) under Settings > Security.

## Need access to more Cloudinary tools?

We're continuing to add more functionality to these MCP servers. If you'd like to leave feedback, file a bug or provide a feature request, please open an issue on this repository.

## Troubleshooting

**"Claude's response was interrupted..."**

If you see this message, Claude likely hit its context-length limit and stopped mid-reply. This happens most often on servers that trigger many chained tool calls such as the asset management server with large asset listings.

To reduce the chance of running into this issue:

* Try to be specific, keep your queries concise.
* If a single request calls multiple tools, try to break it into several smaller tool calls to keep the responses short.
* Use filtering parameters to limit the scope of asset searches and listings.

**Authentication Issues**

Ensure your Cloudinary credentials are correctly configured and have the necessary permissions for the operations you're trying to perform.

## Paid Features

Some features may require a paid Cloudinary plan. Ensure your Cloudinary account has the necessary subscription level for the features you intend to use, such as:

- Advanced AI analysis features
- High-volume API usage
- Custom metadata fields
- Advanced transformation capabilities
